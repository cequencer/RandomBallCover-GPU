- make use of void* to clean up code
- fix problems related to limitations on number of kernel launches
- Make sure that the code works with r,s that are not powers of 2

- Currently, the scan Kernel is limited to 1024*1024.

- consider putting iteration limit on findRangeKernel-- in fact this
  is necessary for the case when there are multiple points at the 
  same distance

- findRangeKernel will be called with too few rows to make use of the
  processor.  So this is another reason to break it down so that 
  each block contains only one or a few rows.
